# Restricted-Boltzmann-machines-as-a-Generative-model-for-generic-protein-structure
We investigate modern optimization techniques for Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their effect on model quality and computation on generic linear proteins consisting of polar and non-polar amino acids sequences. First, the number of hidden layers can be reduced to only one without any loss of generality, reducing computation considerably. Second, implementing Adam compared to Vanilla-SGD shows better stability but slower convergence. Third, increasing the number of Contrastive Divergence steps and performing the Centering Trick allows a faster convergence and performance at the expenses of more computational time.
